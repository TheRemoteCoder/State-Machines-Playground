## General

Diagrams

- [ ] Create diagram (UML notation) for ship/shield concept

Code

- [ ] Best practices - Debugging, Testing (ALL states)
- [x] Nested/parallel state machines (Robot: via invoke)?
  - Complex to setup, even harder to debug/maintain -> Best practices?
- [x] Timed/Async state machines (Delay in transition, e.g. timeout)
  - Can be done with promises

## Technologies

- [ ] Build 'Ship + Shield' state machine with XState
