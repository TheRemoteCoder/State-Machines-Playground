## About

Comparison of Robot and XState for basic concepts and API features.

The basic test scenario for both is a state machine imaginable for a Sci-Fi game, 
where players have a space ship which can activate a shield (limited times).

Besides that, some arbitrary advanced concepts are tested and experimented on.
